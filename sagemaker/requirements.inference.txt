# Minimal Python dependencies for YOLOv8 inference only
# Optimized for faster Docker builds

# Core ML libraries (PyTorch already in base image)
ultralytics>=8.0.0

# Image processing
Pillow>=9.5.0
numpy>=1.24.0

# Note: torch, torchvision already in base image
# Removed: opencv-python, pandas, pyyaml, tqdm, psutil, sagemaker, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn
# These are only needed for training, not inference
